// DOM is very useful we can map the entire document in an object
// we can target specific elements with the help of DOM in javascript for ex. we can change the background color given in 7th line
// whenever you do the inspect element on a website and a element is selected then it gets marked with $0,
// then u can write the css for that element with $0.backgroundcolor.....

document.title = "Peace"
console.log(document.title)
console.log(document.body)
document.body.style.backgroundcolor = "green";
