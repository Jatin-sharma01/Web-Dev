-----------------javascript---------

1.javascript is a object based prog. lang.
2.javascript is a scripting lang. that enables you to create a dynamic content.
3.javascript uses 
   	a.web dev.
	b.web applictn
	c.presentation
	d.server applicn
	e.web servers
	f.mobile applicant
	g.smart watch applicat,art,games
	h.client side validn
	
4. advantages
	a.efficient performance
	b.easy to learn and implement
	c.less server interaction
	d.platform independent
	e.portability
	f.easy to grab syntax
	g.asyncronous prog.
	h.reduce server load
	i.speed and simplicity

5. disadvantages
	a.code visibility
	b.debugging issue
	c.single inharitence
	d.slow DOM
	e.SEO challenges
	f.security risk
	g.slow rendering
	h.

6. object oriented vs object based

	object orinted supports oops concept ( c, c++,java).
	object based does not supports oops concept like inharitence polamorism ( javascript).
	object orinted does not have built-in object.
	object based have built-in object.
	//object based means its difficult to write the code and security isnt good bcz of the
	 impresence of the oops concept //
	//object oriented means its easy to write the code and also its good in terms of 
	security bcz of the oops concept . this lang is also called procedural lang//
	java is an object oriented lang as its support all the concept of oops concept like extraction,inheritance,linkedlists,
	javascript is an object based lang bcz u can use class and object but cant use inharitence(class from another class),extraction,and encapsulation.

7. javascript variables
	a.numbers ex. let a=3;
	b.strings	let name="btech";
	c.object	let obj = { 
						  name:"sunil",
						  age:40,
						  place:"bangalore",
						  pass:true
						  }
	d.array		let array =[{ 
						  name:"sunil",
						  age:40,
						  place:"bangalore",
						  pass:true
						  },{ 
						  name:"sunil2",
						  age:402,
						  place:"bangaloree",
						  pass:false
						  }]
	e.functions		const myfunc=(data)=>{}

#Built in methods in js.
1.Date() = return the present date and time
2.concat() = joins two strings and returns the new string
3.push() = add items to an array
4.pop() = remove last item of an array
5.round() = round the value to the nearest integer and return it
6.length() = return the lenth of the string / number /array and etc


#scope of variables in js
1.scope of variables implies where the variables has been declared or defined in js program. it is of two types one is global scope and another is local scope.
 global scope- global variable having globle scope are available everywhere in js program/code.
 local variable- are accessible in a particular function


#callback in js
const myfunc=(callback)=>{
	return callback
}


#function declaration 						vs 						function expression
1.declared as a seperate statement		   	|		1.created inside an expression or some other construct
	within the main js code					|
2.it can be called before the function 	   	|		2.created when the execution point reaches it(can be used only after that)
	is defined								|
3.offer better port reliability 	   		|		3.used when there is need for conditional declaration of a function
4.ex- function data(){						|		4. var a= function data(){   
	return 2								|					return 2           
} 											|			 }


#cookie
1.cookie is a generally small data that is sent from a website and stored on a user machiene by a web browser
that was used to access the website
2.cookies are used to remember the information for later use and also to refer the browsing activity on a website

READ- read the users input and passes the js datastructure and store in memory
EVAL- takes and evaluate the datastructure
PRINT- print the result
LOOP- loop the above command until user stop it or press control+c twice

#pure component
it is sub class of component and support all the component api.
extending pure component is equivalent to defining a custom component.

#component
component are independent and reusable bits of code. they serve the same purpose as a js function
but work in isolation and returns html
